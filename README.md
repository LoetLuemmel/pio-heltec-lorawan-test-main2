<h1>Boatmonitor Test</h1>

With this build we try to identify, if the Heltec ESP32 LoRa V3 board can be sucessfully programmed with the Platformio EDI.

The top line is a Heltec ESP32 LoRa V3 board in Swizerland.
Yet no connection, but maybe connection could be established over the course of this afternood.

The bottom device is a Heltec ESP32 LoRa V2 board on a Norbert Walter boatmonitor, located in Slovenia.
Luckily it has a gateway nearby. -
Dataflow is quite reliable.
