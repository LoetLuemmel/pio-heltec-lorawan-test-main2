<h1>Boatmonitor Test</h1>

With this build we try to identify, if the Heltec ESP32 LoRa V3 board can be sucessfully programmed with the Platformio EDI.
Compilation, flashing and functional application has been already proven. - But the LoRa WAN functionality is the critical part, that is missing for our Boatmonitor.

<h3>Current Situation:</h3>

The top line is a Heltec ESP32 LoRa V3 board in Swizerland.
Yet no connection, but maybe connection could be established over the course of this afternoon.

* UPDATE
  I successfully connected to TTN on the aitport Munich arriving from Geneva. I used my powerbank to suppy the V3 Heltec Board.  ðŸ«£




The bottom device is a Heltec ESP32 LoRa V2 board on a Norbert Walter boatmonitor, located in Slovenia.
Luckily it obviously has a TTS gateway nearby. -
Dataflow is quite reliable.
